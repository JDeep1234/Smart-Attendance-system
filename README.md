# Face Recognition Based Attendance System

## Description
This repository contains the code for a Face Recognition Based Attendance System developed using Python and Tkinter for the GUI. The system utilizes OpenCV for facial recognition, allowing users to register students, take attendance, and view attendance records. It provides a user-friendly interface for taking images, saving profiles, and tracking attendance using a webcam.

## Key Features
- Register students by capturing their images and entering their details.
- Save student profiles for future recognition.
- Take attendance using facial recognition technology.
- View attendance records with student names, dates, and times.
- Secure password protection for sensitive operations.
